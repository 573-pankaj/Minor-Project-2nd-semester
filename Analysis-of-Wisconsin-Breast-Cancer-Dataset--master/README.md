# Analysis-of-Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-Dataset-

In this project we will compare three machine learning classification techniques using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis dataset. We will create three classifier models that discriminates benign and malignant breast lumps and test the accuracy of the model and report the performance. 

The first part of this project will present the dataset, when and how it was created, if it is noisy, does it have any missing values and so on. This section will focus on understanding the issues that will need to be processed while preparing the data to create the classifier. 

In the second part we will create three different classification models on the dataset namely k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. After building these models we will compare the performance in terms of Confusion Matrix, Classification Error Rate, Precision, Recall and F1 Score.
