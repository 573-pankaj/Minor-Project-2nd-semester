# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin
This is Data set to Classify the Benign and Malignant cells in the given data set using the description about the cells in the form of columnar attributes. There are Visualizations and Analysis for Support.

This data was donated by researchers of the University of Wisconsin and includes the measurements from digitized images of fine-needle aspirate of a breast mass.

You can find the dataset at https://github.com/dataspelunking/MLwR/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20with%20R%20(2nd%20Ed.)/Chapter%2003/wisc_bc_data.csv.

The breast cancer data includes 569 examples of cancer biopsies, each with 32 features. One feature is an identification number, another is the cancer diagnosis and 30 are numeric-valued laboratory measurements. The diagnosis is coded as "M" to indicate malignant or "B" to indicate benign.

The other 30 numeric measurements comprise the mean, standard error and worst (i.e. largest) value for 10 different characteristics of the digitized cell nuclei, which are as follows:-

# Radius
# Texture
# Perimeter
# Area
# Smoothness
# Compactness
# Concavity
# Concave Points
# Symmetry
# Fractal dimension
